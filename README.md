# Data Vis

There are a few known issues with this app.
with the buy/sell functionality, (currently the only accurate values are with no actions, but i just recently broke all that).
With the Resimulate button, only runs once.
With the value for bank?

It is created as a way to experiment with manipulatable data and decision making based on trend data.
